# MongoDB integration

The MongoDB integration provides a way to mirror onchain data to a MongoDB
collection of your choice. Data is automatically inserted as it's produced by
the chain, and it's invalidated in case of chain reorganizations.

 - The integration can be used to **populate a collection with data from one or
   more networks or smart contracts**.
 - Create powerful analytics with MongoDB pipelines.
 - Change how collections are queried without re-indexing.


### Installation

```
apibara plugins install sink-mongo
```


### Configuration

 - `connectionString: string`: the Mongo connection URL of your database.
 - `database: string`: the target database name.
 - `collectionName: string`: the target collection name.
 - `collectionNames: [string]`: a list of target collection names. See the "Multiple Collections" section for more information.
 - `entityMode: boolean`: enable entity mode. See the "Entity
   storage" section for more information.


### Collection schema

The transformation step is required to return an array of objects. Data is
converted to BSON and then written to the collection. The MongoDB integration
adds a `_cursor` column to each record so that data can be invalidated in case
of chain reorganizations.


### Querying data

When querying data, you should always add the following property to your MongoDB filter
to ensure you get the latest value:

```ts
{
    "_cursor.to": null,
}
```

The "Storage & Data Invalidation" section at the end of this document contains
information on why you need to add this condition to your filter.


### Entity storage

The MongoDB integration works with two types of data:

 - Immutable logs (default): the values returned by the indexer represent
   something that doesn't change over time, in other words they're a list of
   items. For example, they represent a list of token transfers.
 - Mutable entities: the values returned by the indexer represent the state of
   an entity at a given block. For example, token balances change block by
   block as users transfer the token.

You can index entities by setting the `entityMode` option to true. When you set
this option, the indexer expects the transform function to return a list of
update operations. An update operation is a JavaScript object with an `entity`
property used to filter which entities should be updated, and an `update` property
with either an [update
document](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/#std-label-updateMany-behavior-update-expressions)
or an [aggregation
pipeline](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/#std-label-updateMany-behavior-aggregation-pipeline).


**Example**: our indexer tracks token ownership for an ERC-721 smart contract
together with the number of transactions for each token.
We enable entity storage by setting the `entityMode` option to `true`.
The transform function returns the entities that need update, together with the
operation to update their state.

```ts
export default function transform(block: Block) {
  // Example to show the shape of data returned by transform.
  return [
    {
      entity: { contract, tokenId: "1" },
      update: { "$set": { owner: "0xA" }, "$inc": { "txCount": 1 } }
    },
    {
      entity: { contract, tokenId: "2" },
      update: { "$set": { owner: "0xB" }, "$inc": { "txCount": 3 } }
    },
  ];
}
```

The integration will iterate through the new entities and update the existing
values (if any) using the following MongoDB pseudo-query:

```ts
for (const doc of returnValue) {
  db.collection.updateMany({
    filter: doc.entity,
    update: doc.update,
    options: {
      upsert: true,
    }
  });
}
```

Notice that in reality the query is more complex, please refer to the next
section to learn more about how the MongoDB integration stores data.

### Multiple Collections

You can write to multiple collections at the same time using the
`collectionNames` option, doing so the transform function should specify what
collection to the write the data to:
- For standard mode, put the returned data in a `data` key and add a
  `collection` key, the returned value will look like `{ data: any, collection:
  string }`
- For entity mode, just add a `collection` key to the returned object, it
  should look like `{ entity: any, collection: string, update: any }`

### Storage & Data Invalidation

Storing blockchain data poses an additional challenge since we must be able to
rollback the database state in case of chain reorganizations.
This integration adds an additional `_cursor` field to all documents to track
for which block range a piece of data is valid for.

```ts
type Cursor = {
    /** Block (inclusive) when this piece of data was created. */
    from: number,
    /** Block (exclusive) at which this piece of data became invalid. */
    to: number | null,
};
```

It follows that a field is valid at the most recent block if its `_cursor.to`
field is `null`.

**Example**: we're indexing an ERC-721 token with the following transfers:

 - block: 1000, transfer from 0x0 to 0xA
 - block: 1010, transfer from 0xA to 0xB
 - block: 1020, transfer from 0xB to 0xC

If we put the token ownership on a timeline, it looks like the following diagram.

```txt
1000                    1010                  1020
--+-----------------------+---------------------+---- - - - - - - -
  [ { owner: "0xA }       )
                          [ { owner: "0xB" }    )
                                                [ { owner: "0xC" }
```

Which translates to the following documents in the MongoDB collection.

After the first transfer:

```json
[
    { "owner": "0xA", "_cursor": { "from": 1000, "to": null } }
]
```

After the second transfer:

```json
[
    { "owner": "0xA", "_cursor": { "from": 1000, "to": 1010 } },
    { "owner": "0xB", "_cursor": { "from": 1010, "to": null } }
]
```

And after the third transfer:

```json
[
    { "owner": "0xA", "_cursor": { "from": 1000, "to": 1010 } },
    { "owner": "0xB", "_cursor": { "from": 1010, "to": 1020 } },
    { "owner": "0xC", "_cursor": { "from": 1020, "to": null } }
]
```
